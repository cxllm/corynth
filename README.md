# Corynth

Corynth is a small discord bot with many features. This repository is here so that you can submit issues, fork and
contribute, and even use some of the code for yourself.<br>

## Using the Code

Feel free to use some of Corynth's code, while not using the majority of it. The point of this being open sourced is
that you guys are able to help out with bugs and also so that you are able to use some of the code, however, I'd rather
not see Corynth clones appearing all of a sudden, so I would appreciate it if you wouldn't copy a majority of the code
or large chunks, as I've dedicated a lot of time and effort to this project

## Beta Branch

Here I will be testing new features in Corynth, and you can see the code and
contribute [here](https://github.com/cxllm/corynth/tree/beta)
