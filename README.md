# Corynth
Corynth is a small discord bot with many features. This repository is here so that you can submit issues, fork and contribute, and even use some of the code for yourself.<br>
## Using the Code
Feel free to use some of Corynth's code, while not using the majority of it.
The point of this being open sourced is that you guys are able to help out with bugs and also so that you are able to use some of the code, however, I'd rather not see Corynth clones appearing all of a sudden, so I would appreciate it if you wouldn't copy a majority of the code or large chunks, as I've dedicated a lot of time and effort to this project
