# Corynth
Corynth is a small discord bot with many features. This repository is here so that you can submit issues, fork and contribute, and even use **some** of the code for yourself.<br>
## Using the Code
Leading off the previous point, yes you may use **some** of the code for yourself, however, you **MAY NOT**:
- Clone this code and publish it as your own
- Use a large portion/all of the code

If this is found to have happened, the bot's code will be taken off GitHub and will no longer be publicly available.
